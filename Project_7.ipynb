When the beams meet again, they interfere with each other, creating patterns of light and dark fringes. These interference patterns can be analyzed to measure very small differences in distance, changes in refractive index, or other physical properties. Interferometers are used in a wide range of applications, from fundamental physics experiments and gravitational wave detection to precision engineering and metrology."

When he continuously attenuated the source stength, even then he found out fringes. We could argue that at very high attenuation levels, there was at most only one photon at a time between the source and the screen. He thought photons passing by the slit one at a time give rise to interference. Dirac famously said \"Each photon interferes with itself, interference between two photons doesn't occur\".  "

        "\n",
        "The quantum nature of light has been a subject of intense investigation since the early 20th century. While classical electrodynamics describes light as a continuous electromagnetic wave, quantum mechanics introduces the concept of photons - discrete packets of energy that exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. This report examines two groundbreaking experiments by Grangier, Roger, and Aspect that conclusively demonstrate quantum behavior at the single-photon level. The first experiment provides definitive evidence for photon anticorrelation at a beam splitter, violating classical wave predictions. As Grangier et al. state in their 1986 paper: \"quantum mechanics predicts a perfect anticorrelation for photodetections on both sides of the beam splitter (a single-photon can only be detected once!), while any description involving classical fields would predict some amount of coincidences.\" This result fundamentally challenges classical wave descriptions of light. The second experiment demonstrates high-visibility interference fringes (more than 98%) in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer using triggered single photons, establishing the wave-like behavior of individual photons. Together, these experiments provide a comprehensive demonstration of wave-particle duality at the single quantum level."

        "The anticorrelation experiment addresses a fundamental question in quantum optics: what happens when a single photon encounters a beam splitter? Classical wave theory predicts that the light wave divides at the beam splitter, resulting in simultaneous detection events (\"coincidences\") at both output ports. In contrast, quantum theory predicts that the photon must choose one path or the other, resulting in perfect anticorrelationâ€”zero coincident detections. As emphasized in the LMI Paper: \"The violation of inequality $p_c \\geq p_r p_t$ gives an 'anticorrelation' criterion, for characterizing a nonclassical behaviour.\" This inequality represents the classical lower bound for coincidence counts that any wave theory must satisfy."
